## **Core Theme**: Cyberpunk Dystopia – *High-Tech, Low-Life*

The world of **Axiom: Neo Tokyo** is advanced, but society is broken. Technology has outpaced morality, leaving the powerful in control while the weak struggle to survive. Mega-corporations rule the city, replacing traditional governments, while the privatized police force enforces a system dictated by profit. 

Neon lights and holograms hide the rot beneath—a city filled with cybernetic implants, digital surveillance, and a constant fight for survival.

### **Humanity vs. Machine**

- **What does it mean to be human** in a world where cybernetic enhancements are the norm? 
- Some embrace full cybernetic transformation, merging mind and machine, while others believe in preserving the soul, resisting artificial augmentation.
- AI and synthetic beings challenge the idea of individuality. Do they deserve rights, or are they mere tools for the elite?

---

### **Corporate Control vs. Free Will**

- The corporations own everything—housing, healthcare, even people’s memories and consciousness. 
- The working class can barely survive without corporate contracts that trade loyalty for stability.
- A growing underground resistance fights back, but they are fractured—some seek revolution, others just want to escape.

The protagonist is caught in the middle: **Will they serve the system, fight against it, or forge their own path?**

### **A Fusion of Traditional Japanese Culture & Futurism**

- **Shogunate Corporations**: The largest corporations adopt the discipline and hierarchy of the samurai, using cybernetic warriors to maintain control.
- **Neon Ronin**: Mercenaries and rebels without a master, rejecting corporate loyalty to forge their own destiny.
- **Silicon Shinto**: A cyber-religious faction that believes in the sacred fusion of man and machine, pushing the limits of transhumanism.

The world blends ancient traditions with futuristic technology—Shinto shrines next to holographic billboards, cyber-samurai enforcing corporate law, and monks with neural implants seeking enlightenment.

### **Choice & Consequence – The Player’s Path Matters**

Morality isn’t black and white. Every choice has consequences, shaping the player’s alliances, enemies, and the fate of Neo Tokyo.

- **Karma-like System**: Tracks how the protagonist interacts with factions and the world. Are they a savior, a tyrant, or something in between?
- The world reacts to the player’s actions:
  - Helping the rebels may lead to corporate crackdowns.
  - Selling out to corporations may bring wealth but strip away freedom.
  - Going solo might make the protagonist powerful, but isolated and hunted.

## **Atmosphere & World Design Influences**

To reinforce the game's theme, the world should feel:

- **Dark, Neon-Lit, and Layered**: A city of high-tech luxury on top and decaying slums below.
- **Crowded & Chaotic**: The streets are filled with holograms, drones, and cyber-enhanced citizens just trying to get by.
- **Traditional Meets Futuristic**: Ancient temples with digital priests, cybernetic sumo wrestlers, and Yakuza crime lords running black-market augmentation rings.
- **Glitchy & Imperfect**: Even with all the technology, nothing works perfectly—corruption, data leaks, and malfunctioning implants create a sense of instability.
